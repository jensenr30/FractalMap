FractalMap
=========

This is a program is in early development.

The point of this program/game is to allow the user/player to explore a world that has infinite precision.
It is our goal to make a map that is made up of a linked block structure that becomes more and more detailed as the user "zooms into" the map.
The user will be able to zoom in practically infinitely.
The user will also be able to zoom out practically infinitely.
The amount that a user can zoom out will be limited by the data types used (signed long long int).
so on most modern machines that will be plus or minus 9.223372e+18 levels from the origin.
although, practically, your hard drive would run out of memory before you used even a small fraction of those levels.
